# Crop Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Overview
For farmers and other agricultural decision-makers, crop prediction is a crucial undertaking. Accurately predicting which crops would be best to grow given soil and environmental conditions can have a significant impact on agricultural profitability and productivity. 

By creating a crop forecast model that uses machine learning techniques to give farmers well-informed predictions, our study seeks to address this challenge. By examining forecasted rainfall, soil composition, and meteorological factors, this project's main goal is to help farmers choose the best crops to grow. The program can forecast which crops are most likely to flourish in a given environment by taking these characteristics into account.

## Existing System
Estimating yield and predicting crops are essential for agricultural decision-making. Traditional crop forecast methods that rely on manual analysis of historical data face accuracy and efficiency issues. To address these concerns, this project suggests a machine learning-based strategy.

The model utilizes historical data and advanced algorithms to produce precise and efficient predictions for optimal crop selection. By incorporating this model into an intuitive web application, farmers can enter parameters and get real-time crop suggestions, enhancing accessibility and usefulness. 

## Proposed System
This project proposes a machine learning-based approach for crop prediction using historical crop data and associated environmental factors. The **Random Forest Classifier** algorithm is chosen due to its efficiency in classification tasks. 

The Random Forest method builds multiple decision trees and aggregates their predictions to enhance accuracy in crop selection. The model efficiently analyzes environmental factors such as:
- Rainfall
- Soil composition
- Temperature
- Humidity
- pH level

Using these factors, the model suggests the best crop to grow in a given environment.
