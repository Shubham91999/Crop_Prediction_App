**Overview**<br>
For farmers and other agricultural decision-makers, crop prediction is a crucial undertaking. Accurately predicting which crops would be best to grow given soil and environmental conditions can have a big impact on agricultural profitability and productivity. By creating a crop forecast model that uses machine learning techniques to give farmers well-informed predictions, our study seeks to address this difficulty.
By examining forecasted rainfall, soil composition, and meteorological factors, this project's main goal is to help farmers choose the best crops to grow. The program can forecast which crops are most likely to flourish in a given environment by taking these characteristics into account.
